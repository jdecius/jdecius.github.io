											<h3>Web Design Final Project</h3>
											<p> This is my final project for my Web Design Class, which was meant to showcase the applications of html and css on our own web pages with free reign of artistic and creative expression once the base elements of the project were executed properly.

											<h3>New York Times API ETL Pipeline</h3>
											<p>
												In this project I was tasked with making an ETL pipeline with any field of data from the New York Time's API that could make any human process easier. After choosing what data to process, we had to develop a code to make the information human readable and ready to use in a saved file.

											<h3>TrAceso Group Project</h3>
											<p>
												In this group project, my group mates and I had to collaborate throughout the entire semester on a technological business venture. Through the semester we had to create a powerpoint and contribute our own subsections of the project that we would in some way be an "expert" on as it pertained to our project. By the end of our project, we had the blueprint for our business venture that we could try to use to create the TrAceso Project in the real world if we desired. The project was meant to fill a need in a technological industry that would not only make a difference, but each team member was in some way passionate about prior to the project beginning. We all had an interest in health.

											<h3>Data Analyitics Final Project: The Impacts of Race and Finances on Education</h3>
											<p>
												This study was independent research conducted by myself that I wanted my own questions answered for because the subject is important to. 
												Throughout the semester I was able to choose my own field of big data to study and analyze. Through the semester each part of the project would help build on the previous part if you saw fit.
												I took this as an opportunity to study what I believe my college education has cultivated toward. I got to mix information technology, africana studies, and American studies 
												into a sinle study, that showed just how much, race, household income, and the price of college tuititon can all have an impact on the potential 
												for a person to graduate college.

											<h3> Why Information Technology? </h3>

											<p>
												Since I was a child, some of my most memorable moments were spent being in front of some type of technology with the people I love. My household got a computer and consistent internet around the time I turned 10 and I have been in love with technology ever since. Some of my earliest memories on the internet were learning dance moves with my oldest brother on youtube in 2007. Unbenounced to me, this innocent fun would stay with me forever and unknowingly fuel my love for technology. As I entered college I was faced with the decision of which major to choose, and like many unsuspecting undergraduate students I wanted to major in a field that was lucrative, so I chose to major in computer science. As I progressed through undergrad I soon realized although I had a love for technology, this would not crossover into the field of computer science and a career path with heavy coding. That was when I stumbled across the major of Information Technology and took a class called Social Informatics, which taught me the bridge between human interaction and technology that constantly played with one another in a constant relationship, each molding the other into advancement for the generation to come. That was when I knew information technology was for me. As the world continues to move forward we will continue to embed technology more and more into our everyday lives, and this idea alone is interesting to me. I’ve always had a curiosity, which having computers with search engines helped me quel. The interaction between humans and technology is not only the future, but a future I want to directly contribute to because technology and loved ones, once saved me long ago.

											<h3> Future Goals/ Mission </h3>
											
											<p>
												I want to help fight the fight against the technological divide and technological racism. Technology belongs to nobody, and should be open to everybody who so hopes to use it. We live in a world where there are those who have and misuse technology while there are people who miraculously find a way despite not having many technological resources at their disposal. I know how it feels to be underprivileged, feel inferior, or just hopeless in your situation and I want to use technology so people don't have to go through that ever again. I know there is no one size fits all into this, but the beauty of technology is that it is so vast and takes on different shapes and sizes. With the internet and social media people have power at their fingertips (that I too am also guilty of underappreciating), people can make a difference in their lives for themselves and their loved ones as well. Technology can create the escape that people need to live a good life, and I want to share it with as many people as possible.
